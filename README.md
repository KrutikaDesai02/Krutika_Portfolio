# [Project 1: House Price Prediction: Project Overview](https://github.com/KrutikaDesai02/HousePricePrediction)
* Build a model that predict property price based on certain features such as bedroom, bathroom, sq feet, location etc. So, the task is to build a website using HTML/CSS/JavaScript that predicts estimated price for your house.
* In terms of project architecture, we are going to take a home set from Kaggle.com. Using that data set we will make a machine learning model. While building the model we are going to cover some data science concepts such as data cleaning, feature engineering, Dimensionality reduction, outliner detection etc.
* Once the model is built, we are going to export it to a pickle file and then we will write a python flask server which will consume this pickle file and do price prediction for us.
* This python flask server will expose HTTP endpoints for various requests and the UI written in HTML/CSS/JavaScript will make HTTP Get and Post calls.
* In terms of tools and technology we will use python as programming language, Pandas for data cleaning, Matplotlib for data visualization, Sklearn for model building, python flask for a back-end server, HTML/CSS/JavaScript for building our website.

# [Project 2: Sports Person Classifier: Project Overview](https://github.com/KrutikaDesai02/SportsPersonClassifier)
* This is an end to end project on Image classification where our end goal is to build a website where you can drag and drop an image of a sport person and it will identify that sport person name.
* We have used Fatkun Chrome Tool to gather images and did data cleaning using Haar Cascade from OpenCV. We did feature eEngineering using Wavelet Transforms
* We will build a model first, hyper tune it, exported to a file, then we will run a python flask server and our website will make a call to that python flask server. 
* From our website we drop an image of Sport person to identify his/her name.
